The provided calculator implementation in C++ has several issues:

Inefficient Multiplication: The multiply function uses repeated addition, which is not efficient.
Division by Zero Handling: The divide function returns -1 when division by zero occurs, which might be mistaken as a valid result.
Result Validation: The main function does not check if the division was invalid before printing the result.

Explanation
Efficient Multiplication:

The multiply function now uses the built-in * operator for multiplication, which is efficient and straightforward.
Division by Zero Handling:

The divide function checks for division by zero and prints an error message. Instead of returning -1, it returns numeric_limits<int>::min(), a special value indicating an error. This value is the smallest possible integer, unlikely to be a valid result of normal calculations.
Result Validation:

In the main function, before printing the result of a division operation, we check if the result equals numeric_limits<int>::min(). If so, we return immediately after recognizing the error has already been reported.
